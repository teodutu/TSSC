# Casino

There's a new casino in the [virtual] town, we've heard it hosts plenty of bitcoins.

Some say it is rigged.
We managed to "fetch" the binary code of the server, but can't figure it out.

Can you check it out? We'll make it 50/50 ;)

Should you try your solution, the casino server's address is
`isc2021.root.sx:10003`.


### Hints:

  - after succeeding locally, make sure to run your exploit on the server!
  - use netcat with input piping; e.g. `echo "input" | nc <server> <port>`;
  - remember the x86 (32-bit) calling convention ;)
