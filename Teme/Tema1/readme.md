# Introduction to Computer Security - Homework 1

Deadline: please see curs.upb.ro !

## Homework Customizer

Please download your customized homework from [http://isc2021.root.sx].
Enter your Moodle username (WITHOUT the email domain or '@').
Example: "florin.stoian".

This will generate your customized homework archive.

## Homework Description

The homework contains 3 tasks:

  - `task1`: cryptography, 0.66p
  - `task2`: access control (linux flag hunt), 0.67p
  - `task3`: binary exploit, 0.67p

Each task challenges you to find a "flag", a string with the form
`SpeishFlag{<random hash>}` generated for your user.
There is a single flag per task: if you got one with the appropriate syntax, it
will be accepted as the correct solution (please take care when decoding or
manually copying it, e.g. zero vs 'o').

WARNING: the flag is case sensitive! Please copy the whole string (including the
`SpeishFlag{...}`) into the solution file!

Note that some tasks will require an online connectivity, while some are fully
contained within the archive.
You can also experiment locally, when possible (e.g., binary reverse
engineering).

WARNING: any form of cybernetic attack (especially Denial of Service) on the
homework infrastructure is strictly forbidden!

Your final solution will be in the form of a ZIP archive containing the
following files:

  - `flag1`: flag for the first task;
  - `flag2`: flag for the second task;
  - `flag3`: flag for the third task
  - `username.txt`: your username (the same as you entered inside the homework
    archive generator webpage)!
  - `readme.txt`: for each task, briefly describe your approach (keep it short,
    please!);
  - any custom scripts you coded for solving the homework (please don't include
    third party tools, link them in your readme instead).

Please keep the file names as above and available inside the archive's
root directory!

The solution archive must be uploaded to Moodle (https://curs.upb.ro) BEFORE the
deadline!

Note: an automated checker is not included because it is unnecessary: if you
discover the (solely) hidden flag for a task and it has the form mentioned
above, it most certainly will be the correct one and you will get the points (we
also manually check them for typos, though take care when copying them).

If you have any questions, please use the Moodle forum and/or the Teams channel.

Good Luck!
